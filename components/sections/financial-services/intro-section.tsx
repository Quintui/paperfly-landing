            Yet many financial institutions still manage RFP creation and vendor
            evaluation through fragmented systems, manual processes, and
            unstructured vendor submissions â€” introducing unnecessary risk and
            slowing decision-making.

            Our platform helps financial institutions create compliant, bilingual
            RFPs, collect vendor responses in a standardized format, and
            instantly score submissions to make vendor selection faster, clearer,
            and more defensible.
