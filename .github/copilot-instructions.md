## How to update production or the live page

## Creating a New Page

Before creating a new page, always review the styles, colors, and design conventions defined in `@page`. Ensure your new page matches the existing look and feel.

To update the production site or make any changes live, simply commit your changes and push them to the `main` branch. The deployment will happen automatically.

**Steps:**

1. Add your changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit your changes:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
   ```
3. Push to main:
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```

That's it! Your changes will be deployed automatically.
